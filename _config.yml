about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  I am a versatile and creative programmer with a background in architecture and IT.
  I discovered my passion for programming when I was doing parametric designs as an undergraduate student in architecture.
  I decided to pursue a master's degree in IT to deepen my knowledge and skills in this field.
  The unique combination of architecture and IT experiences enables me to approach problems from different perspectives and deliver high-quality results.
  I am a fast learner and a problem solver who always strives to deliver value and quality to the projects I work on. I hope to grow as a real developer.

  The things that I currently have the most experience working with are:
  <mark>Java</mark>, <mark>Python</mark>, <mark>MySQL</mark>
  <mark>JavaScript</mark>, <mark>CSS</mark>, <mark>Vue</mark> and <mark>PHP</mark>

  I also have some experience with the <mark>SpringBoot</mark> framework,
  machine learning, and <mark>Dafny</mark> verification-aware programming language.

          This is a team project based on a project proposal to facilitate cultural exchange
          and ease the loneliness of international students. The frontend is implemented
          using <mark>Vue</mark>, and the backend is implemented using Java and <mark>
          SpringBoot</mark> framework, with a <mark>MySQL</mark> database. I designed
          the entire UI interfaces, implemented most of the front-end programming and half
          of the back-end programming.

          This website is designed to increase the usage of the public green space of Brisbane.
          The website is implemented using <mark>PHP</mark>. The website will retrieve data from the Brisbane
          government website and stores it in <mark>MySQL</mark>, which is handled by <mark>phpMyAdmin</mark>.
          It uses ToroPHP to realize RESTful, which will then invoke corresponding handlers to deal with request.
          After handling the data, a view is created.

          UQ offered me the opportunity to pivot into computer science from a non-traditional background.
          While I spent a year developing foundational CS knowledge through MIT OpenCourseWare, UQ enabled
          me to apply this learning in a practical setting. 

          Though new to the field, my self-directed preparation and multidisciplinary design perspective
          facilitate quick learning.I excelled in programming and design computing courses and did several
          projects by myself. However, I'm more eager to build real-world experience.

          My architecture education taught me that good design
          means balancing innovative style with human needs. 
          Initially focused on designing eye-catching buildings,
          I soon learned to prioritize functionality and purpose.
          A building's appearance became secondary to the value and purpose it serves. 
          These architectural user-centered design principles apply broadly to other fields.
          
          My favourite architect, Zaha Hadid, showed me architecture could also
          leverage new technologies like parametric design. I saw an opportunity
          to combine these interests by using computation to enhance user experience.
          This led me to explore computer science.
